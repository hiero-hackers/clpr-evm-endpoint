/**
 * Unit tests for {@link LocalNetworkAdapter#accountSubmitterFor}, the sharing rule that the
 * nonce-collision fix (issue #258, PR #283) rests on.
 *
 * <p>{@link org.hiero.clpr.relay.evm.AccountTransactionSubmitter} guarantees that <em>one</em>
 * submitter never reuses a nonce — its single serial worker reads {@code latest} once per request and
 * confirms each transaction before dequeuing the next. That guarantee only removes cross-connection
 * collisions if every connection signing from the same key on the same chain actually resolves to
 * <em>the same submitter instance</em>. Each connection independently calls
 * {@code network.accountSubmitterFor(signer)} during {@code ClprConnectionHandler.create()}; if that
 * ever handed back distinct instances, each would start its own worker thread, each would read
 * {@code latest} independently, and the collision would be back regardless of how well-behaved any
 * individual submitter is.
 *
 * <p>The nonce space is per {@code (chain, account)}, so the cache key is the signing <b>address
 * alone</b> — deliberately not the {@code ClprService} address. Two {@code clprServices[]} entries on
 * one network sharing a key must share one submitter; the contract they submit to is layered on top
 * as a {@code forContract(...)} view, not baked into the key. {@link
 * #sameKeyAcrossServices_sharesOneSubmitter} pins that, because narrowing the key to
 * {@code (address, serviceAddress)} is a plausible-looking change that would silently reintroduce the
 * bug for multi-service deployments.
 *
 * <p>No EVM node is needed: {@link LocalNetworkAdapter#create} only builds clients and registers a
 * metrics updater that fires on scrape, and a started submitter's worker blocks on an empty queue
 * without issuing any RPC.
