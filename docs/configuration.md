# Configuration, Running, and Testing

Prerequisite: `docs/README.md`.

## Configuration sources

Three layers, highest priority first:

1. **System properties** — `-Drelay.<key>=<value>`.
2. **YAML file** — `relay.yaml` in CWD by default. Override with `-Drelay.configFile=<path>` or `RELAY_CONFIG_FILE=<path>`.
3. **Built-in defaults** — declared in `clpr-relay-app/.../RelayConfig.java`.

`relay-config-example.yaml` (in `clpr-relay-app/src/main/resources/`) is the canonical schema with inline docs.

**Note:** `localNetworks[]`, `clprServices[]`, and `peerProofTypes` are YAML-only — they are lists/maps of structured objects that the property-based config model cannot represent. System properties can override only the scalar `grpc.*` and `backoff.*` blocks.

## Schema (top-level)

The config is a three-tier hierarchy: `localNetworks[]` (a chain the relay talks to) → `clprServices[]` (a `ClprService` contract deployed on one of those networks) → channels (predefined by id and/or discovered on-chain, brought online by the service handler). `RelayInstance` builds a `LocalNetworkAdapter` per network, a `ClprServiceHandler` per service, and a `ClprChannelHandler` per channel.

| `grpc.port`                                     | `9545`            | Inbound peer-sync RPC port.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `grpc.maxMessageSize`                           | `1048576` (1 MiB) | Maximum gRPC message size in bytes. Applied symmetrically to the inbound PBJ-Helidon server (overrides the 10 KiB PBJ default that is too small for typical bundles and QBFT proofs) and to outbound `ClprEndpointClient` Netty channels (`maxInboundMessageSize`). Validated `> 0` at startup.                                                             |
| `grpc.sync.tlsEnabled`                          | `false`           | When `true`, the sync listener is mandatory mTLS (`clientAuth=REQUIRED`) and `tlsKeyPath` is required. When `false`, the sync listener is plaintext and `tlsKeyPath` is ignored.                                                                                                                                                                            |
| `grpc.sync.tlsKeyPath`                          | `""`              | Path to this endpoint's ECDSA P-384 CA private key (PKCS#8 PEM or DER). The relay mints an Ed25519 leaf signed by this key at startup and presents it at every handshake; the CA certificate is never read from disk. Required when `tlsEnabled=true`.                                                                                                      |
| `grpc.sync.leafCertValiditySeconds`             | `86400` (24 h)    | How often the in-memory leaf certificate is re-minted (seconds). The leaf is regenerated on demand the first time a TLS handshake occurs after the window elapses, so no handshake fails on expiry. Set to `0` to disable rotation (the leaf is then valid for 10 years). Ignored when `tlsEnabled=false`.                                                  |
| `backoff.baseMs`                                | `1000`            | First-failure backoff (ms) for the per-channel loops; doubles per consecutive failure up to `capMs`. Validated `> 0`. See `architecture.md` → Threading model.                                                                                                                                                                                              |
| `backoff.capMs`                                 | `30000` (30 s)    | Ceiling on the per-failure backoff (ms). Bounds both retry cost and ERROR-log volume on a persistently-failing channel.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                     |
| `localNetworks[].id`                            | — (**required**)  | Unique string id referenced by `clprServices[].localNetwork`.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `localNetworks[].proofType`                     | — (**required**)  | `ProofType` discriminator: `QBFT` (Besu/QBFT) or `CometBFT` (Sei). Selects the `getLedgerConfiguration` payload and the inbound `BundlePayloadCodec`. `Hiero` is valid only as a resolved peer proof type, not for a local network.                                                                                                                         |
| `localNetworks[].evm`                           | — (**required**)  | Common EVM connection parameters (see sub-table). Required for both `QBFT` and `CometBFT` networks.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `localNetworks[].qbft`                          | defaults          | QBFT proof parameters (see sub-table). Applies to `QBFT` networks; omit to accept defaults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                 |
| `localNetworks[].cometBft`                      | defaults          | CometBFT proof parameters (see sub-table). Applies to `CometBFT` networks; omit to accept defaults.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                         |
| `clprServices[].serviceAddress`                 | — (**required**)  | Checksummed hex address of the deployed `ClprService` contract. The default zero address is a non-functional placeholder. Multiple services may target the same `localNetwork`.                                                                                                                                                                             |
| `clprServices[].localNetwork`                   | — (**required**)  | `id` of a `localNetworks[]` entry. The relay submits `submitBundle` transactions on this chain for the service's channels.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                  |
| `clprServices[].defaultSigningPrivateKeyHex`    | `""`              | secp256k1 hex (with or without `0x`) signing key for every channel on this service without a per-channel override. The EVM sender address is derived from it. **Required** when the service discovers channels or has a predefined channel without its own key; validated at startup.                                                                       |
| `clprServices[].discoverChannels`               | `false`           | Poll this service contract for `ChannelCompleted` events and register channels that appear on-chain after startup. Requires `defaultSigningPrivateKeyHex`. Opt-in.                                                                                                                                                                                          |
| `clprServices[].discoveryStartBlock`            | `0`               | Block from which discovery begins its `ChannelCompleted` log scan. Set to the block the `ClprService` was deployed at to avoid rescanning from genesis. Also the floor a reorg-triggered rescan resets to.                                                                                                                                                  |
| `clprServices[].predefinedChannels`             | `[]`              | 32-byte hex channel ids registered at startup (used when discovery is disabled, or alongside it). Each channel's peer proof type is resolved from its on-chain peer `chainId` (see `peerProofTypes`).                                                                                                                                                       |
| `clprServices[].perChannelSigningPrivateKeyHex` | `{}`              | Per-channel signing-key overrides keyed by channel id. A channel listed here signs with its own key instead of `defaultSigningPrivateKeyHex`.                                                                                                                                                                                                               |
| `peerProofTypes`                                | `{}`              | Top-level map of peer CAIP-2 `chainId` (e.g. `eip155:1337`, `hiero:mainnet`) to the peer's `ProofType`. Resolves each channel's peer proof type (predefined and discovered) from its on-chain peer `chainId`. An EVM (`eip155:*`) peer with no entry falls back to the local network's `proofType`; a non-EVM peer with no entry is unservable and skipped. |

Channel-level settings are not per-channel config: the commitment level (`LATEST`), sync cadence (`ChannelSyncTask.DEFAULT_INTERVAL_MS`), and proof-lag (`2` for a CometBFT network, `0` otherwise) are applied uniformly to every channel a service serves.

### `localNetworks[].evm` sub-table

Common EVM connection parameters (`CommonEvmParams`). Present on both `QBFT` and `CometBFT` networks — both run an EVM JSON-RPC and the `ClprService` contract.

|          Key          |         Default         |                                                                                 Notes                                                                                  |

| `jsonRpcUrl`          | `http://localhost:8545` | HTTP URL of the EVM JSON-RPC endpoint. HTTP only; WebSocket subscriptions are not used.                                                                                |
| `chainId`             | `1`                     | EIP-155 chain id. Used for client-side signing.                                                                                                                        |
| `maxGasPriceCap`      | `Long.MAX_VALUE`        | wei. Hard cap enforced by `Eip1559GasStrategy`: a computed `maxFeePerGas` over this value fails the submission as `FAILED`. Set positive to protect against spikes.    |
| `gasPriorityFee`      | `2_000_000_000`         | wei (2 gwei). EIP-1559 priority fee (`maxPriorityFeePerGas`), passed through unchanged.                                                                                |
| `gasBufferMultiplier` | `1.2`                   | Applied to the chain's current `baseFeePerGas`; `maxFeePerGas = round(baseFee × multiplier) + gasPriorityFee`.                                                         |
| `pollIntervalMs`      | `1000`                  | Interval (ms) between successive on-chain state polls by the listener. Validated `> 0`.                                                                                |
| `requestTimeoutMs`    | `30000` (30 s)          | Per-request JSON-RPC response timeout (ms). On expiry the request is treated as a transient error and retried up to `maxRpcRetries` times. Validated `> 0` at startup. |
| `maxRpcRetries`       | `3`                     | Max JSON-RPC retry attempts on transient errors (connection refused, timeout, HTTP 429/503). Total attempts is one more than this. Validated `> 0` at startup.         |

### `localNetworks[].qbft` sub-table

QBFT proof parameters (`QbftConfig`). Applies to `QBFT` networks.

|               Key               | Default |                                                    Notes                                                    |
|---------------------------------|---------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `epochLength`                   | `30000` | QBFT epoch length used to compute the epoch-boundary block header for the `getLedgerConfiguration` payload. |
| `maxEpochBlockHeadersPerBundle` | `5`     | Maximum epoch block headers to include in a bundle when the remote trust anchor is behind.                  |
| `maxMessagesPerBundle`          | `10`    | Maximum messages to include in a single bundle.                                                             |

### `localNetworks[].cometBft` sub-table

CometBFT proof parameters (`CometBftConfig`). Applies to `CometBFT` networks; configures the CometBFT proof path (the EVM side is configured via the `evm` block).

|              Key              |         Default          |                                                                         Notes                                                                          |

## Running

```bash
./gradlew :clpr-relay-app:installDist
clpr-relay-app/build/install/clpr-relay-app/bin/clpr-relay-app
# or:
java -Drelay.configFile=/etc/clpr/relay.yaml -jar clpr-relay-app/build/libs/clpr-relay-app.jar
```

The Prometheus metrics endpoint is on `localhost:9547` by default (the gRPC info plane uses 9546).

## Production checklist

- At least one `localNetworks[]` entry, and at least one `clprServices[]` entry with `serviceAddress` set to the real deployed `ClprService` address on its network.
- Each `clprServices[].defaultSigningPrivateKeyHex` (or every channel's per-channel override) configured — a service that discovers channels or has an unkeyed predefined channel refuses to start otherwise. All transactions are client-signed as EIP-1559 raw transactions; no node-side wallet is involved.
- `localNetworks[].evm.chainId` matches the target chain for each local network.
- `localNetworks[].evm.maxGasPriceCap` set to a finite ceiling on each local network.
- Each signing account holds enough native token on its local chain to pay gas for sustained `submitBundle` traffic. See spec §2.3 and §8.10.

## Tests

### Unit tests

Per-module under `src/test/java`. Run all: `./gradlew test`. Notable suites:
- `clpr-relay-evm`: `AbiCodecTest`, `EthSignerTest`, `EvmJsonRpcClientTest`, `AccountTransactionSubmitterTest`, `Eip1559GasStrategyTest`, `QbftBundleConstructorTest`, `QbftProofCodecTest`, `SeiBundleConstructorTest`, `SeiLedgerConfigurationProviderTest`.
- `clpr-relay-sync`: `ChannelSyncTaskTest`, `PeerSelectorTest`, `PeerEndpointCacheTest`.

### Integration tests

In `clpr-relay-integration-tests/`. Run with `./gradlew :clpr-relay-integration-tests:test`.

Layout:
- `IntegrationTestBase` — common fixtures.
- `AnvilContainer`, `BesuContainer` — Testcontainers-managed local EVM nodes (Foundry Anvil and Hyperledger Besu, respectively).
- `ContractDeployer`, `ContractInteractor`, `ContractArtifact`, `DeployedContracts` — admin/test driver that deploys the CLPR contract and exercises the full admin surface (`registerEndpoint`, `registerChannel`, `completeChannel`, `registerConnector`, `completeConnector`, `updateLedgerConfiguration`, `sendMessage`, etc.). The relay process itself only ever calls `submitBundle` and the read methods.
- Scenario tests:
- `OneWayMessageTest` — single message ledger A → B.
- `ReplyFlowTest` — request/response.
- `BidirectionalMessageTest` — concurrent A↔B.
- `RelayRecoveryTest` — relay restart preserves state (recovery via on-chain reads).
- `*ContainerSmokeTest` — sanity-check the EVM containers boot and accept transactions.

The contract bytecode/ABI artifacts the integration tests deploy live in the `clpr-hiero` companion repo; `ContractArtifact` resolves them at test time. There are no `.sol` or compiled artifacts in this repo.

### How the relay's behavior is exercised end-to-end

The integration tests run two relay instances against two distinct EVM containers and drive a full CLPR scenario:

1. `ContractInteractor` deploys `ClprService` on each chain, calls `registerEndpoint` for each relay's endpoint, and creates a channel via the commit-reveal pair (`registerChannel` → `completeChannel`).
2. `updateLedgerConfiguration` is called to publish each chain's seed endpoint set (pointing at the other relay).
3. The two relays start, read the ledger config, and begin syncing.
4. The test drives messages by calling the contract's `sendMessage` and asserts the messages arrive on the other side via state reads.

The corresponding Hiero-side native CLPR test surface (HAPI BDD specs in `clpr-hiero/.../test-clients/.../suites/clpr/`) is the analog of this when the peer is a Hiero ledger, not an EVM ledger.

## Logging and metrics

- Logging via `swirlds-logging`; configuration through standard JUL `logging.properties`.
- Metrics via `swirlds-metrics-api` exposed as Prometheus on the metrics port. Notable counters:
  - `sync.cycles.total`, `sync.cycles.failed`, `sync.no_peer_skips`, `sync.no_proof_skips`.
  - Bundle outcome (metered in `AccountTransactionSubmitter`, labeled by `channel_id`): `sync.bundle.submissions` (receipt-confirmed successes only), `sync.bundle.messages_submitted`, `sync.bundle.bytes_submitted`, `sync.bundle.reverted`, and `sync.bundle.skipped` (labeled `reason=rejected` — the gas-free on-chain preview reverted, which also covers stale/duplicate bundles; `reason=empty` — an empty **ACTIVE** initial-state bundle dropped before any preview; a status-only close at the same counters is not empty and still submitted).
  - `grpc.sync.requests`, `grpc.sync.errors` (labeled `reason=parse_error|submit_error`).
  - EVM transactions (metered in `AccountTransactionSubmitter`, labeled by `channel_id`): `evm.tx.submissions` (receipt-confirmed), `evm.tx.reverts`, `evm.tx.failures` (labeled `reason=validation|encode|gas|send|abandoned`; a `gas` failure means the gas-price cap was breached and no transaction was sent, and an `abandoned` failure means the request hit the `MAX_SUBMIT_ROUNDS` safety valve without an on-chain verdict and was left for the sync loop to re-drive), `evm.tx.queue_dropped` (a submit request dropped because that channel's per-channel queue was full), and `evm.tx.queue_deduped` (a re-offered bundle suppressed because byte-identical bundle was already queued for that channel).
  - **Resource gauges (scrape-time updaters).** Refreshed by a `metrics.addUpdater` on each Prometheus scrape:
    - `evm.gas_price.base_fee_wei` (`LongGauge`, labeled `network`; registered per `LocalNetworkAdapter`) — the latest block's EIP-1559 base fee per gas in wei, i.e. the floor of every submission's max-fee. Skipped on pre-London chains (no base fee).
    - `evm.account.balance_eth` (`DoubleGauge`, labeled `account` + `network`; registered per `AccountTransactionSubmitter`) — the signing account's `latest` balance in ETH. Watch for drift toward zero: a drained account can no longer land `submitBundle` transactions.
  - **Loop-failure aggregates (per-endpoint, never per-channel).** Each per-channel loop family exposes a monotonic failure counter plus two scrape-time gauges computed from the live channel handlers' `FailState` (registered by `RelayInstance`). There are **no** `channelId`-bearing series (swirlds has no labels; the offending channel appears in the ERROR logs and a future `/healthz`, not the TSDB):
    - sync loop: `sync.cycles.failed` (counter), `sync.channels.failing`, `sync.channels.max_consecutive_failures` (gauges).
    - listener poll loop: `evm.listener.poll.failed` (counter), `evm.listener.channels.failing`, `evm.listener.channels.max_consecutive_failures` (gauges).
  - Endpoint-manifest: `evm.listener.manifest.refreshed` (counter) — peer manifest cache refreshes applied after an on-ledger manifest-version advance; `evm.manifest.read.failed` (counter, labeled `scope=local|peer` and `reason=rpc_error|decode_error`) — a `getEndpointManifest`/`getPeerEndpointManifest` `eth_call` or decode failed (the read degrades to an empty manifest; the WARN is throttled, so this counter is the reliable signal).
