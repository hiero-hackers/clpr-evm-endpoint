/**
 * Fully-serialised, queue-based transaction submitter for a single EVM signing account (EOA) on one
 * chain. One instance is shared by every channel/service that signs from the same key on the same
 * network.
 *
 * <p><b>Why this shape.</b> A single dedicated worker thread drains bounded per-channel FIFO
 * queues (round-robin; see below) and drives each request to a <em>definite on-chain verdict</em> — a mined receipt (success or revert) or a
 * definite pre-mempool rejection — before taking the next one, so <em>at most one transaction per
 * account is ever in flight</em>. That property is what removes the need for any nonce tracking: the
 * nonce is read once from the account's {@code latest} (mined) transaction count immediately before
 * signing, and because nothing of ours is unconfirmed at that point, {@code latest} is always the
 * correct next nonce. There is no local nonce cache to drift, no mempool backlog to bound, and no
 * cross-channel nonce collision to serialise against.
 *
 * <p><b>Drive to a verdict, then a bounded safety valve.</b> The transaction is signed at the fixed
 * nonce and re-sent each unmined round. Rather than bump the fee blindly on a timeout — with a large
 * gas limit that would inflate {@code maxFee * gasLimit} toward the account balance and the node's
 * per-tx fee cap and strand the transaction — each round re-reads the <em>live market fee</em>: if it
 * now exceeds what we last signed, the tx is re-priced up to it (clamped to the gas-price cap) and
 * re-signed at the same nonce; if it is the same or lower, the current tx is re-sent verbatim. This
 * clears a base-fee rise that occurs after the tx is pooled (which re-appears as "already known",
 * never "underpriced") by tracking the market instead of over-bumping. The fee is also raised when
 * the node explicitly reports it under-priced. The worker stops driving a request when it observes a
 * mined receipt, a definite pre-mempool rejection, a confirmed nonce advance past ours (some other tx
 * took the slot), or — the safety valve — after {@code MAX_SUBMIT_ROUNDS} without a verdict. That cap is essential: the single worker advances
 * round-robin only once a request finishes, so one permanently unmineable transaction would otherwise
 * wedge every channel sharing the key. Abandoning does not drop the bundle — the sync loop
 * reconstructs and re-submits it from fresh on-chain state.
 *
 * <p><b>Per-channel queues, round-robin drain.</b> Requests are held in one bounded FIFO
 * <em>per channel</em>, and the single worker drains them round-robin — one request per
 * channel per turn — so a high-volume or misbehaving channel cannot starve the others that
 * share this account. Within a channel, order is preserved and requests are never coalesced (a
 * re-poke never evicts an already-queued bundle); when one channel's queue is full its
 * <em>new</em> request is dropped (WARN + {@code evm.tx.queue_dropped}), which bounds memory and
 * cannot block the sync loops or affect any other channel.
 *
 * <p><b>Duplicate suppression.</b> A bundle whose <em>exact bytes</em> are already pending in a
 * channel's queue is suppressed at enqueue ({@code evm.tx.queue_deduped}). The pull
 * {@code ChannelSyncTask} and push {@code ClprSyncHandler} paths both re-offer the same bundle
 * repeatedly while it is undelivered; without this the FIFO fills with identical copies and a
 * genuinely-new bundle is dropped at enqueue. This is content-exact, not counter-keyed — so unlike the
 * removed {@code (next, acked, status)} fingerprint it can never suppress a distinct PAUSE-recovery
 * bundle carrying the same counters as the offending one, and it keeps the existing entry rather than
 * letting a re-offer displace it. It is only a queue-hygiene guard: the true duplicate gate remains
 * the gas-free {@code eth_call} preview run just before each paid submission — a bundle the chain has
 * already applied reverts the preview (replay / running-hash mismatch) and is skipped without spending
 * gas. Because the worker is serial and confirm-before-advance, the second of two overlapping bundles
 * is previewed only after the first has mined, so it reverts. The one thing skipped without a preview
 * is an empty <em>ACTIVE</em>
 * initial-state bundle ({@code nextMessageId ≤ 1}, {@code receivedMessageId == 0}, status
 * {@code ACTIVE}) — it would revert {@code EmptyBundle}. A status-only close (CLOSING/DRAINED/CLOSED)
 * at those same counters is <em>not</em> empty and is always submitted so the lifecycle advances.
 *
 * <p>This class owns the per-channel bundle-outcome metrics (tagged {@code channel_id}): a
 * preview-rejected bundle increments {@code sync.bundle.skipped} ({@code reason=rejected}); a
 * receipt-confirmed submission increments {@code sync.bundle.submissions} plus the
 * {@code messages_submitted} / {@code bytes_submitted} volume counters and {@code evm.tx.submissions};
 * a reverted submission increments {@code sync.bundle.reverted} and {@code evm.tx.reverts}; a
 * fee-computation or send failure increments {@code evm.tx.failures}; a queue-full drop increments
 * {@code evm.tx.queue_dropped}; and an exact-duplicate re-offer suppressed at enqueue increments
 * {@code evm.tx.queue_deduped}.
