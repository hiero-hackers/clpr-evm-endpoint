/**
 * Queues messages on a channel side, fast enough to build a real backlog.
 *
 * <p>Two properties make this more than a loop around {@code sendMessage}. Sends are pipelined —
 * signed against a locally tracked nonce and fired without waiting for receipts — because a
 * receipt-per-send loop tops out at one message per block and can never produce a queue. And the
 * batch is spread over several sender accounts, since a node bounds how many future transactions one
 * sender may have pooled (200 in Besu by default) and silently drops the rest.
 *
 * <p>Sender accounts are separate from the endpoints' signing keys and from the channel operator. A
 * shared account would interleave two independent nonce sequences on one address and produce
 * {@code nonce too low} rejections that look exactly like the relay-side submission bug this suite
 * exists to detect.
