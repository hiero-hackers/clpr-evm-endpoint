/**
 * Declarative description of one CLPR channel: the two chains it spans and the endpoints that serve
 * each side.
 *
 * <p>A channel needs an endpoint on <b>each</b> side. Chain A's endpoint reads A, builds a bundle and
 * calls {@code sync} on chain B's endpoint, which submits it to B. One process serving both sides is
 * a known relay gap (opt-in only in clpr-e2e), not a supported topology.
 *
 * @param networkA one side's chain
 * @param networkB the other side's chain
 * @param endpointsA endpoints serving side A; one entry is the normal sharded shape, several make the
 *     side redundant and the endpoints compete for the same bundle
 * @param endpointsB endpoints serving side B
 * @param connectorStakeWei stake locked when the connector is registered; must meet the service's
 *     minimum
 * @param connectorFundingWeiA plain ETH sent to side A's connector contract
 * @param connectorFundingWeiB plain ETH sent to side B's connector contract. Funded per side because
 *     the underfunded-connector scenario needs exactly one side starved: the service checks the
 *     <em>receiving</em> side's connector balance before dispatching an inbound message, and starving
 *     both would also block the reply travelling the other way — turning one intended failure into two
 *     and making the test prove nothing in particular
 * @param salt32 operator-chosen label mixed into the channel id; {@code null} generates a fresh
 *     random one, so re-running a test never collides with a previous run's channel
