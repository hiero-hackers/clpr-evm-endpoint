/**
 * Whether the relay drains a queue that built up while it was down.
 *
 * <p>Split by expected outcome, because the two halves of that question have different answers today.
 * A backlog <b>up to</b> the relay's per-bundle batch drains correctly. A backlog <b>beyond</b> it does
 * not: the relay bundles only the first batch but carries a running hash for the whole queue, so the
 * peer rejects every bundle, the received watermark never advances, and the channel is wedged for good
 * (a known upstream limitation).
 *
 * <p>Keeping them in one class with honest names is deliberate. A single "drains 500 messages" test
 * would be red and would say nothing about whether the framework works.
