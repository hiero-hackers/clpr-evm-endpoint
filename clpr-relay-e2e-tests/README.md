# CLPR EVM Endpoint — E2E Test Framework

Black-box end-to-end tests for the `clpr-evm-endpoint`. The endpoint runs as a **container**; real
Besu QBFT chains run beside it; the **production** `QBFTVerifier` validates every bundle. Nothing is
stubbed on the path under test.

```bash
RUN_E2E_TESTS=1 ./gradlew :clpr-relay-e2e-tests:test   # 16 tests, ~15 min
```

**One test is currently red, on purpose.**
`BacklogDrainE2ETest.drains_a_backlog_larger_than_the_bundle_batch` tracks an open relay bug
(`clpr-hiero#171`) and will keep failing until it is fixed — see
[Known failure](#known-failure) below. Everything else is green.

Requires Docker, JDK 25, and `../clpr-smart-contracts` checked out with `forge build` run.

## Running from an IDE

The suite is opt-in via **either** switch:

|         Switch          |                       Where                       |
|-------------------------|---------------------------------------------------|
| `RUN_E2E_TESTS=1`       | environment variable                              |
| `clpr.e2e.enabled=true` | `gradle.properties`, or `-Dclpr.e2e.enabled=true` |

IDEs do not pass your shell's environment to their Gradle runs, so use the property there — put
`clpr.e2e.enabled=true` in `gradle.properties` (project or `~/.gradle/`) once and IDE runs work
without per-configuration fiddling. Setting `RUN_E2E_TESTS=1` in the run configuration's environment
works too.

With neither switch set, every method is disabled by the extension's `ExecutionCondition`. That is
harmless for a full run (`0 tests, BUILD SUCCESSFUL`) but **fails** when combined with a `--tests`
filter, which is what an IDE always sends:

```
No matching tests found in any candidate test task.
    Requested tests: Test pattern org.hiero...UnderfundedConnectorE2ETest in task :clpr-relay-e2e-tests:test
```

The class is disabled, so JUnit produces zero test descriptors, and a filter with zero matches is a
build failure. The message names the filter rather than the missing switch — if you see it, this is
why.

## Writing a test

```java
@E2ETest(timeoutSeconds = 900)
void messages_flow_across_a_channel(final E2EEnvironment env) {
    final BesuNetwork besuA = env.besuNetworks().add(BesuNetworkSpec.singleNode());
    final BesuNetwork besuB = env.besuNetworks().add(BesuNetworkSpec.singleNode());

    final EvmEndpoint epA = env.endpoints().add(EvmEndpointSpec.defaults().withId("ep-a"));
    final EvmEndpoint epB = env.endpoints().add(EvmEndpointSpec.defaults().withId("ep-b"));

    final Channel channel = env.channels()
            .create(ChannelSpec.between(besuA, besuB).endpoints(epA, epB));

    env.startAll();   // chains → contracts → channel wiring → endpoints

    final InjectionRun run = env.messages().enqueue(channel.a(), 8, MessageShape.small());
    run.awaitAllConfirmed(Duration.ofMinutes(3));

    env.await().peerReceivedAll(channel.a(), run.messageIds(), Duration.ofMinutes(5));
    env.await().queueDrained(channel.a(), Duration.ofMinutes(5));
}
```

Objects are **declared** first and brought up by `startAll()`. That split is required, not stylistic:
the QBFT genesis has to embed the validator set and prefunded accounts, and the on-chain peer roster
has to embed each endpoint's IP address — none of which is known until the topology is complete.

### Adding a channel while the endpoints run

`startAll()` is a convenience for the common case. A test that needs endpoints running *before* a
channel exists drives the phases itself and then wires the channel for discovery:

```java
env.besuNetworks().startAll();
env.besuNetworks().deployAll();

// Empty channel list: discovery fills it in.
epA.serve(besuA, List.of()).addPeerProofType(besuB.caip2(), "QBFT");
epB.serve(besuB, List.of()).addPeerProofType(besuA.caip2(), "QBFT");
env.endpoints().startAll();

final Channel channel = env.channels().create(ChannelSpec.between(besuA, besuB).endpoints(epA, epB));
env.channels().wireForDiscovery(channel);            // on-chain only, no endpoint reconfiguration
env.await().channelLive(epA, channel.metricLabel(), Duration.ofMinutes(3));
```

The endpoints must be declared with `.withDiscoverChannels(true)`. The relay reads its configuration
once at startup, so a channel wired afterwards is invisible to an endpoint that only has
`predefinedChannels` — it has to poll the service for `ChannelCompleted` events.
`wireForDiscovery` rejects the call outright if a serving endpoint cannot discover, because otherwise
the channel would exist on chain, both relays would look healthy, and nothing would ever be delivered.

`wireAll()` skips channels it has already wired, so it is safe to call again.

`@E2ETest` gives each method its own environment, closed afterwards. Per-method isolation is
mandatory: a channel whose backlog exceeded the relay's bundle batch is wedged permanently, so a
shared environment would let one test poison the rest.

## What it can do

**Chains** — generate Besu QBFT genesis (validator keys, `extraData` RLP, static-nodes, 64 prefunded
accounts), run multi-node networks, `start`/`stop`/`restart`/`kill`/`pause` per node. Chain state
lives in host directories, so a restart resumes rather than resetting to genesis.

**Contracts** — deploy the full CLPR stack per chain: six logic modules, `ClprService`, real
`QBFTVerifier(1)`, `E2EApplication`, plus a per-channel `QbftE2EVerifier` wrapper and
`MockClprConnector`.

**Channels** — the whole wiring: commit-reveal on both chains, the two RLP config proofs the real
verifier demands (10-field config proof + slot-`0x12` endpoint-manifest proof), connector
registration with stake and prepaid execution budget, peer-roster seeding.

**Endpoints (the SUT)** — containers built from the shipped jars and the production
`docker-entrypoint.sh`; generated `relay.yaml`; the signing key arrives through the real
`__SIGNING_KEY_*__` sentinel substitution. Pinned IPs survive restarts, because
`ClprService` validates seed endpoints as IPv4 literals and stores them verbatim in the peer roster.

**Load** — pipelined sends (locally tracked nonce, no receipt round-trip) spread over four sender
accounts per chain, so a real backlog can form. Message ids come from `MessageQueued` events, and a
backpressure mode holds the in-flight window at a chosen depth.

**Faults** — pause/resume a chain or node, kill or pause an endpoint, partition and rejoin it on the
Docker network (restoring its pinned address), drain an endpoint's signing account, make a connector's
`payForExecution` revert.

**Observation** — Prometheus scrape with label support, log capture that survives container removal
and restarts, and a chain inspector for blocks, receipts, revert lists and per-sender nonce
histograms (duplicate nonce ⇒ two submitters raced one account; gap ⇒ a transaction was lost).

## Test suites

|             Suite             |                                                   What it establishes                                                   |
|-------------------------------|-------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `BesuNetworkE2ETest`          | generated QBFT genesis actually mines; multi-node networks form; chains get distinct ids                                |
| `ContractStackE2ETest`        | the real verifier stack deploys and the service accepts mutating calls                                                  |
| `EndpointContainerE2ETest`    | the container runs the shipped relay; restart keeps IP and key; scrape semantics                                        |
| `SingleChannelSmokeE2ETest`   | a channel comes up across two chains against the real verifier                                                          |
| `BacklogDrainE2ETest`         | sub-batch backlog drains; rolling restarts under load lose nothing; over-batch case is the known failure                |
| `UnderfundedConnectorE2ETest` | a starved connector is a business outcome, not a relay failure, and the channel recovers; relay survives a chain outage |
| `ChannelDiscoveryE2ETest`     | a running endpoint picks up a channel wired after it started, and delivers over it                                      |

Assertions target the hard property, not the convenient one: block production rather than port
reachability, bytecode at the deploy target rather than "an address came back", and a sync cycle
attributed to the channel id rather than a healthy container — a channel whose on-chain protocol
version mismatches is skipped in silence.

## Constraints worth knowing

- **One QBFT validator per chain.** `QBFTVerifier` reverts with `MultiValidatorNotSupported()` on a
  multi-validator epoch header. Use `BesuNetworkSpec.of(n)` — one validator plus full nodes — for a
  genuinely multi-node, still-verifiable network.
- **Non-zero gas price.** The connector-affordability check is guarded by `tx.gasprice > 0`, so
  `minGasPriceWei` defaults to 1; a zero-price chain makes that whole path unreachable.
- **One operator per channel.** The channel id is derived from the operator public key, so both sides
  must use the same one or the second `completeChannel` reverts with `ClprInvalidChannelId`.
- **Sequential runs.** Environments take a fixed `/24` each; the allocator walks forward on overlap,
  but cross-JVM parallelism would need a file lock. `maxParallelForks = 1`.
- **`E2EProfile.CI`** exists (2×2 nodes, ≤4 endpoints, hard heap caps) but has not been exercised on a
  CI runner yet.

## Diagnostics

Diagnostics are written **only when a test fails**. A passing test leaves nothing behind, so any
directory under `build/e2e-output/` means something failed there — an empty tree after a green run is
correct, not broken.

On failure, `build/e2e-output/<Class>/<method>/` gets:

|            File             |                        Contents                        |
|-----------------------------|--------------------------------------------------------|
| `failure.txt`               | the assertion, the active profile, the stack trace     |
| `endpoint-<id>.log`         | the relay's full container output                      |
| `endpoint-<id>-metrics.txt` | the final `/metrics` scrape                            |
| `endpoint-<id>-config.yaml` | the generated `relay.yaml` it started with             |
| `besu-<network>-<node>.log` | each Besu node's output                                |
| `chain-<network>.txt`       | head, chain id, validator, and every mined transaction |

Capture happens *inside* the test invocation, via `TestExecutionExceptionHandler`.
`TestWatcher.testFailed` would be too late: JUnit closes the method-scoped store — stopping every
container — before calling it, so a dump taken there finds nothing running and reports
"endpoint is not started" instead of the log and scrape that explain the failure.
