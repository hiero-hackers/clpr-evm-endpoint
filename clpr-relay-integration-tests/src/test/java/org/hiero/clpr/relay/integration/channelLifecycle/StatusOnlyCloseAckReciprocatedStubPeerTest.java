/**
 * When a peer initiates closing on a channel that has carried no data, the relay must still reciprocate
 * with a signed, verifiable bundle that reflects its own status change — otherwise the peer never learns
 * the relay acknowledged the close and the handshake cannot complete on the peer's side.
 *
 * <p>The inbound close itself now lands — the guarded submitter treats a declared status differing from the
 * local status as progress, so the peer's status-only close drives the relay through
 * {@code ACTIVE → CLOSING → DRAINED} (the channel rides straight to {@code DRAINED} because nothing was
 * ever queued outbound). The remaining gap is the <em>reciprocal</em>: the relay can act on the peer's
 * status but cannot send its own back.
 *
 * <p>The relay must build a reciprocal proof for a bare status change even when nothing else rides along —
 * no pending outbound, no trust-anchor advance, no inbound ack. A closing/draining status is itself
 * something the peer must receive, so the bundle carries the relay's status back to the peer rather than
 * short-circuiting to an empty payload (an empty payload is not a verifiable proof and the peer would
 * discard it, leaving the close unable to complete on the peer's side).
 *
 * <p>This uses a never-used (zero received frontier) channel by necessity — any message the relay
 * receives advances the frontier past zero and takes the ordinary message/ack path, so the bare-status
 * path is only reachable here. The test drives a status-only peer close, waits for the relay to wind down,
 * asserts the reply carries a non-empty bundle reporting the relay's own closing status, then has the peer
 * declare itself {@code CLOSED} to complete the handshake to {@code CLOSED}. The terminal bundle declares
 * {@code CLOSED} rather than {@code DRAINED} because, on a channel whose counters never moved, a
 * peer-{@code DRAINED} bundle would be byte-identical to the relay's own initial state and suppressed.
