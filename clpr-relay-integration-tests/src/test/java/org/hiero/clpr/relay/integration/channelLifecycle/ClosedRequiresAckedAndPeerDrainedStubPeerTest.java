/**
 * A channel must not reach {@code CLOSED} until <em>both</em> conditions hold at once: every outbound
 * message has been acked by the peer, <em>and</em> the peer has announced it is {@code DRAINED} on its own
 * side. {@link DrainToClosedStubPeerTest} proves the positive hop (both conditions satisfied →
 * {@code CLOSED}); this test isolates each condition and proves that, on its own, neither is enough.
 *
 * <p>One narrative drives the single shared channel through the two gates in sequence:
 *
 * <ol>
 *   <li><b>Peer drained, queue not fully acked.</b> The peer declares {@code DRAINED} but acks only the
 *       first of two outbound messages. The channel must stay {@code CLOSING} — a peer announcement
 *       cannot pull it forward while local messages are still unacked.</li>
 *   <li><b>Queue fully acked, peer not drained.</b> The peer acks the remaining message but is still
 *       {@code CLOSING} (not yet drained). The channel advances to {@code DRAINED} and stops there — it
 *       must not slip to {@code CLOSED} while the peer has not finished draining.</li>
 *   <li><b>Both satisfied.</b> The peer announces {@code DRAINED}; with all outbound already acked, the
 *       channel finally reaches {@code CLOSED}.</li>
 * </ol>
 *
 * <p>Runs in {@code POKE_ONLY} mode, so the only driver of any transition is an explicit poke: each gate's
 * outcome is unambiguously attributable to the bundle that was injected.
